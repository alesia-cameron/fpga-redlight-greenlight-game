# fpga-redlight-greenlight-game
 This project implements the game Red Light Green Light, an interactive game with synchronized control and display logic, realized entirely in hardware on an FPGA. The design uses a modular FSM and datapath architecture to demonstrate how hardware executes real time algorithms involving user input, randomness and visual output through VGA graphics
