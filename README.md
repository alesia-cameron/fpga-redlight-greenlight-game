# fpga-redlight-greenlight-game
This project implements Red Light Green Light, an interactive game with synchronized control and display logic, realized entirely in hardware on an FPGA. The design uses a modular FSM and datapath architecture to demonstrate how hardware executes real time algorithms involving user input, randomness and visual output through VGA graphics. 

This project serves as the final project for EE/CSE 371 at the University of Washington. The design was implemented using LabsLand, a virtual FPGA platform that behaves like a physical FPGA board. For a detailed description of the system architecture, design decisions and implementation, please refer to the accompanying lab report and video demo.
